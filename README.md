HoloLens application for designing motion capture setups in augmented reality.

Plays well with Qualisys Miqus cameras.

## Dependencies

Requires:

- [HoloToolkit-Unity](https://github.com/Microsoft/HoloToolkit-Unity) (v1.5.7)
- [Unity Standard Assets](https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/32351)
- [UCLA Game Lab Unity Wireframe Shader](http://games.ucla.edu/resource/unity-wireframe-shader/)

## Notes

- Some sound files and 3D models of motion capture cameras (which are required to compile) are not included here, since I cannot distribute them. Thus. this repo is mainly intended for reference purposes, and to serve as a companion to demonstrations. Those who are interested in compiling and running the full application can do so after replacing the camera model in the 'Miqus' game objects and replacing/removing sounds.
